# PythonSimpleGUI

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

I personally use python for controls application development on Linux or MacOS. This is my take on using Python's TKinter Library to build a simple navigated GUI. Buttons on each page can be customized to my liking and perform functions I would need to employ. I often use this to setup to prototype motor and servo actuation for subjects that are better optimized with programmatic control such as, Robotics and Autonomous vehicle projects.


Here, I implement my own version of a GUI workbench in Python. This allows me to quickly setup and get right into functions by not having to deal with creating a new interface tool each time. Please configure as you please.

Disclaimer: Still need to clean up. May add more pages and updates later on.
